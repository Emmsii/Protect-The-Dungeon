<h3>How the database shit works.</h3>
<small><strike>strike through</strike> = done.</small><br>
<ul>
	<li><strike>Player registers account on website.</strike></li>
	<li><strike>Player can now login to app.</strike> (Even if user doesn't exist/wrong pass, player can still log in atm. App can tell if user exists, just cant GET user data yet)</li>
	<li>Password stored with hash.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>When player enters username and password in application, sends GET url with user and pass. (Make this safer with hashing?)</li>
	<li>If user and pass are correct, get some data from the database.</li>
	<li>If not, app commits seppuku. (I'll think of something to happen if player is offline/bad login/website down. For the moment just kill app.)</li>
	<li>Player comes to character select screen. Max three characters.</li>
	<li>Get character(s) info: id, name, stats, dugneon owned id. </li>
	<li>If no characters exist, player can create one. Character details are POSTed to database.</li>
	<li>Get dungeon info based of selected character id (if character has dungeon built): id, room_string, obj_string.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>When saving dungeon, app sends POST url with dungeon info (see above).</li>
	<li>When player loads world map (see below about world map), app sends GET url to return list of dungeons. </li>
	<li>When player chooses dungeon to attack, app sends GET url to receive dungeon data.</li>
	<li>POST url is sent to say that dungeon is currently under attack. Dungeon cannot be attacked by other players.</li>
	<li>If player wins/looses/out of time, app sends POST url to update dungeon attack status.</li>
	<li>After every attack, no matter what the outcome, app sends POST url with updated character stats.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<b>World Map</b>
	<li>Each dungeon has random x, y coords. </li>
	<li>When world map is requested, dungeon icons are placed in an area based off x, y. </li>
	<li>When new dungeon is created its given unused x, y, coords. </li>
</ul>
